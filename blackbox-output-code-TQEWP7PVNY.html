        <h2>What is Bullying?</h2>
        <p>Bullying is repeated aggressive behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. It can occur in person or online and can have serious long-term effects on victims. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), bullying includes actions like physical harm, verbal taunts, or social exclusion.</p>
        <p>In school premises, bullying often happens in classrooms, hallways, playgrounds, or during extracurricular activities. It's not just "kids being kids" – it's a form of abuse that requires intervention.</p>

        <h2>Effects on Students</h2>
        <p>The impact of bullying on students can be profound and long-lasting. Victims may experience emotional distress, academic struggles, and even physical health issues. Bullies themselves can develop behavioral problems, and bystanders may feel helpless or complicit.</p>
        <p>Short-term effects include anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Long-term, it can lead to issues like substance abuse, poor mental health, and difficulties in relationships. Schools must address bullying to protect all students' well-being.</p>
